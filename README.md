# Loudspeaker Thiele-Small Calculator

## Overview
The Thiele-Small Calculator helps loudspeaker designers to select the component parameters to achieve their design goals. Users can put in the loudspeaker Thiele-Small parameters and the calculator will calculate the components and enclosure parameters.  If a user modify a component parameter the calculator will update the corresponding Thiele-Small parameters.
